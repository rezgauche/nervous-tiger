    content: "\_Our gallery/atelier location is at Rue Theodore Verhaegen 154, Brussels, Belgium.\n\nThe multi-purpose gallery/atelier is open for performance art, dance, artistic research, visual art, theatre, design, music production, audiovisual production and other forms of presenting and gathering around artistic practice.\n\nA large window at the street side lends itself to a view into the gallery. Yet, there is no door that gives front access.\nVisitors need to pass through the gate and the courtyard before entering the space, which allows for a sense of distance between persons at work and mere passersby.\n\nThis display towards the street side has proven itself to be very useful for visual and performance artworks.\nThe performances are viewable from the street, framed within the gallery’s window, sometimes causing consternation because of non-heteronormative interaction, lack of decent costumes, etc.\n\nAlternatively, by adding a curtain, events can happen in a more relaxed intimate setting between persons present. This is often easier when working with research, rehearsals, meetings, meditations, preparing exhibitions, etc. And if the weather allows, the courtyard is nice for gatherings, reflection, and occasional communal events.\n\nSpecific to this location is that nothing (creations, material, artworks, etc) can be placed in the corridors, courtyard, or outside the area of the gallery/atelier, because this obstructs the common use of the building’s occupants. That means in quotidian practice that how you make/do things has to include a consideration of any residuals of your practice. With late night events, the neighbours need to be involved somehow, and/or reduce the volume of evocative noises and music.\n\nIn the area, Porte-de Halle, Place Bethlehem, there are lots of little restaurants, shops,\_ supermarkets, cultural venues (Tricoterie des Liens, Pianofabriek, Jacques-Frank) and art venues (Deborah Bowman, Alma Sarif). On walking distance there is the Wiels contemporary art center, Midi Station, Duden Parc, P.A.R.T.S, Communa asbl Maxima, Artist Commons asbl Chassart studio, and other art spaces etc.\n\n![](/images/rgb-logo.png)\n\n"
