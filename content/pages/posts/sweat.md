*Softly We Entered Another Truth* is rethinking work through practice. It wants to put into question the value of the body: its products, services and experiences.

*S.W.E.A.T*. asks: What is performance when placed in a context of a non-essential, an insubstantial form of art? How can performance art extend beyond a notion of labour time, or beyond valorisation of excessive (re)actions?

*rez gauche* invites you - artists, researchers, makers, performers, etc - to experiment with our research process in an informal, professional, post-work society. Frequency and format of presentation is following the artistic process. Resources, benefits, risks and responsibilities are shared.

*Softly We Entered Another Truth* functions as an experimental practice of a life beyond capitalist consumer culture and engages participants through displacement into artistic practice, love and care.

- mantra's and other linguistic practice
